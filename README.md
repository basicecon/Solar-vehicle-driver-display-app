Project Name: Solar Vehicle Driver Display

Project Description:

Our team aims to develop an android application that will serve as a driver display panel. This application will collect data from the vehicle and send it to the remote server, which will store and analyze it. This project is also part of the Driver Display program for Purdue Solar Racing team, in which one of our team member is serving. 

On application side, the device will collect the current through the battery pack, the power generated by the solar panel, the power consumed by the motor, the current status of the light switch and windshield wiper.

On the server side, the device will receive the data and use sql to store and analyze it. Upon request, the server will transmit the data back to the mobile application for presentation.
